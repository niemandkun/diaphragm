    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
        Hi, everyone! My name is <i>Ivan Poroshin</i> and I'm third year computer science bachelor
        student and enthusiastic programmer, interested in robotics,
        computer vision, bioinformatics and more.
    </p>

    <p>Among the internets you can also find me by nickname <i>niemandkun</i>.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        I have interests in various fields, but the most passionate I am in:
        <ul>
            <li>Robotics</li>
            <li>Bioinformatics</li>
            <li>Computer vision</li>
            <li>Machine learning</li>
            <li>Gamedev and computer graphics</li>
            <li>Functional programming</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        My current location is Yekaterinburg. Here I'm studying math and
        CS as a student of <a href="http://imkn.urfu.ru">The Institute of
        Mathematics and Computer Sciences</a> of
        <a href="http://urfu.ru/en/">The Ural Federal University</a>.

    <h2>Science</h2>
    <p>
        I've spent last summer as a volunteer worker in The Laboratory of
        Mathematical Modelling with Supercomputer Technologies at
        <a href="http://iip.uran.ru">The Institute of Immunology and Physiology RAS</a>,
        where I've got a chance to help the researchers in their study of
        how to cure human heart diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
        There I've learnt computer vision and have written a lot of Python code
        using NumPy, SciPy, pandas, scikit-learn, scikit-image and OpenCV.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a revard I've got a chance to attend
        <a href="http://conf.bionet.nsc.ru/bgrssb2016/?lang=en">The
        International Conference On Bioinformatics of Genome Regulation
        and Structure/Systems Biology</a> at Novosibirsk State University
        as a listener.
        There I've learnt a lot about biology.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, in September 2016 I've attended
        <a href="http://astro.brics.urfu.ru/en/astrodata2016/">BRICS
        Astronomy Workshop</a> as a listener interested in astronomical
        data processing.

    <h2>Programming</h2>
    <p>
        After the first year of studying I've decided to participate with
        my mates in local competitions on virtual robotics, where
        participants were asked to write a program for a fully
        autonomous robot acting in a virtual environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our team was lucky enough to take the first place with the solution
        that used only some graph algorithms and a finite-state automaton.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now I'm taking part in the development of new competitions,
        which involves development and implementation of the contest's rules,
        development of the competitions Unity3D app and the infrastructure
        maintenance.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        As a first years student I wrote a bunch of code in C#, Java and
        Python.

        I'm still loving these programming languages and still using them in my
        daily work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, I've became familiar with Prolog, Haskell and Scala
        and have fallen in love with the functional programming.
        Now I'm solving
        <a href="http://rosalind.info/">Rosalind</a> problems
        using Haskell.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        As a hobby I'm doing various gamedev, web or assembly stuff. Some of
        that stuff is available on my <a href="/projects">projects</a>
        page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides this I like to play games and have a
        <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058887699">Steam</a>
        profile. So, if you'd like to play together, just let me know.
    </p>
    <p>
        Also, I have a
        <a href="http://rosalind.info/users/niemandkun">Rosalind</a> profile.
